This program Draws Backgammon Board!
Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games. Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archaeological discoveries in Mesopotamia.
It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen pieces "Checkers" that move between twenty-four triangles according to the roll of two dice.

1. The program will start by asking the user to enter "Pixels per grid cell".
2. In case the user enters an invalid value for the pixel size, the program will display a warning message and ask the user to enter a valid value!
3. with a valid user input the program will automatically scale the board to that value! (i.e 30 )
